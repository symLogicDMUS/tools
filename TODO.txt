edit and delete buttons disabled when timer is running
Add FAB to TimerList component to add new Timer
add media queries for digit sizes under clock tab

flex row of 3 upward buttons
flex row of 3 digit components
flex row of 3 downward buttons

* the 3 digit components each take a parsed number value as prop

* the number values for minutes, hours, and seconds are stored in values
  until they are returned on save button click

* onIncrement and onDecrement functions listen for increment and decrement events.
(the col string in emitted with the event)
they need to know which column they are incrementing or decrementing for.

eventually, digits default values should be what the timers current start times are,
which should be passed with dialog.open(). for now, set them all to zero.

* eventually, we want to use the <analog-display> component is the edit-timer-dialog,
but for now we will recreate it

* eventually, we should think about adding 'dialog' as 4th tool type to be emitted ny tool service
